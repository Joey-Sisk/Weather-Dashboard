## Usage

[This Weather Dashboard](https://joey-sisk.github.io/WeatherDashboard/) will accept a users input to determine a location and display local weather information. The displayed information is for the current day as well as the next five days. Whenever you seach a city it is saved to the local memory and can be accessed by clicking on one of the buttons under the dearch bar.


This would not have been possible without the help of my tutor Kumar Ramanathan, my instructor Calvin Carter, all of the class TA's, and many of my fellow UT Bootcamp students.
